# JavaScript Interview Concepts

This folder contains **core JavaScript concepts frequently asked in interviews**.  
It’s designed to give you both **theory + practical examples**.

## Topics Covered

| File | Concept |
|------|---------|
| execution_context.js | Global & function execution context, phases |
| call_stack.js | How function calls are managed (LIFO) |
| event_loop.js | JS asynchronous behavior, call stack, callback queue, promises |
| memory_management.js | Stack vs Heap, Garbage Collection, memory leaks |
| shallow_vs_deep_copy.js | Copying objects/arrays, spread vs structuredClone |
| this_keyword.js | How `this` works in different contexts |
| bind_call_apply.js | Function borrowing, `bind`, `call`, `apply` |
| type_coercion.js | == vs ===, implicit/explicit conversions |
| truthy_falsy.js | Falsy values, common pitfalls |
| debouncing_throttling.js | Performance optimizations in frontend |
| polyfills.js | Custom implementations for older browsers |

## Why This Matters

- Tests **deep understanding of JavaScript internals**
- Helps in **frontend & MERN interviews**
- Makes you stand out with **well-commented examples**

## How to Use

1. Open each `.js` file
2. Read **comments & theory**
3. Run examples in Node.js or browser console
4. Revise before interviews
