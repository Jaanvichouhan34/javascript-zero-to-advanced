# How JavaScript Works?

JavaScript is a **single-threaded**, **synchronous**, and **non-blocking** language.

## JavaScript Execution Process

JavaScript code runs in three main steps:

1. **Memory Creation Phase**
   - Variables are allocated memory
   - Functions are stored in memory

2. **Execution Phase**
   - Code is executed line by line
   - Values are assigned to variables

## Example

```js
console.log(a);
var a = 10;
